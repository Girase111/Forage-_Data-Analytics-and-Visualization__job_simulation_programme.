Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization job simulation programme.

Task 1 : Project Understanding
Your first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call.
Read the brief to:
1) Understand the client and business problem at hand.
2) Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
3) Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.

   # Task 2 : Data Cleaning & Modeling
         So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:
1) 7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
2) A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
          There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:
1) Requirements gathering
2) Data cleaning
3) Data modelling

 # Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling
Build your presentation Structure
Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.
For each slide, think about: 
1) Agenda - What will your presentation cover?
2) Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
3) Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
4) The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
As a reminder from the earlier task - this includes: Andrew Fleming (Chief Technical Architect), Marcus Rompton (Senior Principle), and yourself!
5) Process - How did you complete your analysis?

# Task 4: Present to the Client
Record your video
   It is now time to record your presentation to the client.
     Remember, your presentation should be concise, engaging and should tell a compelling story. It should be no longer than 10 minutes.
   Recording the video may require a few attempts until you’re happy with it, but this task shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes.
While the recording functionality in this task won't allow you to share your slides as you speak, it will help you learn how to communicate and use eye contact when presenting
